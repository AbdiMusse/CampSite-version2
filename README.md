PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
This is an improvement to my first dynamic website that I built for my second year assignment in computer science where I received 90% for it. The entire code have been added to this repository.

The goal of the webiste was for me to imporve my skills in PHP and bootstrap. Javascript was used in this project that was used as a front and back end programming language. GoogleMap, infinte scrolling, pagination, ajax calls were used to imporve the number of calls that are made to the back end server to imporve the running of this website. PHP was still used in certain places but this was mainly about Javascript.

The website allows the users to search for Camp sites and get information regarding it. If the user is logged in, the user is able to contatct the ownder and do bookings.

Feel free to have a look around and contact me, leave comments or issue requests with things I could have done better - I'm all about learning how to write better code.
